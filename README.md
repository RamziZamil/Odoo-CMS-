# 🍔 Cloud Kitchen Ordering System - Odoo CMS

This project is a simple yet effective **online food ordering system** for a Cloud Kitchen, built using **Odoo CMS**. It is designed and developed individually by a junior developer as part of a learning and implementation exercise. The system supports full customer interaction — from browsing the menu and placing orders to tracking delivery and managing profiles. The backend is managed entirely through the Odoo admin interface.
